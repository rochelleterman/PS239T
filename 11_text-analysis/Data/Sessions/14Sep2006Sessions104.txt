                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Thursday  September 14  2006      WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senators Richard Burr  R NC   Jeff Sessions  R AL   and Tom Coburn  MD  R OK  today called for more equitable distribution of Ryan White CARE Act funds  saying the funding disparities and the elevated rate of new HIV AIDS infections among Southern rural and minority populations must be addressed   Currently  Southern states  which now account for a majority of HIV AIDS cases in the nation  are being shortchanged in Ryan White CARE Act funding         The three senators raised the issue at a news conference sponsored by the National Minority Health Month Foundation and the Southern AIDS Coalition         Ryan White CARE Act funding provides medical care  anti retroviral treatments  counseling and testing  and other services for HIV AIDS patients          Ryan White CARE Act funding must be distributed more equally among states   North Carolina  s waiting list for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program has been close to 1 000 in recent years   This is unacceptable     Burr said     The Ryan White CARE Act exists to protect and support those living with HIV and AIDS   In North Carolina  we have approximately 18 900 residents living with HIV and AIDS   It is time for Ryan White funds to be distributed more evenly so all patients  not just those living in New York  San Francisco and Boston  can receive the care they need          A recent Government Accountability Office  GAO  investigation found that several funding schemes in the current Ryan White CARE Act program discriminate against rural and Southern states   States with large metropolitan areas benefit from   double counting    in which those with AIDS who live in cities are counted twice  once under title I  large metropolitan area CARE Act funding  and again under title II  state CARE Act funding    Funds are currently being distributed based upon cases of AIDS  the end stage of HIV infection  rather than cases of HIV and AIDS   Those living with HIV in Southern states represent the emerging epidemic and therefore are not counted in CARE Act federal funding formulas   Finally  while shortchanged Southern states have been forced to implement waiting lists and other restrictions for AIDS drugs  GAO found that at least one metropolitan area  San Francisco  receives funding for dead people and is provided twice the amount of funding per AIDS cases as every other area        It is time for HIV and AIDS patients to receive equitable treatment regardless of where they live     Sessions said    Geography should not be a death sentence  and the South in particular has gotten the short end of the stick  Right now Alabama  s patients receive far less assistance than those in big cities  even though Alabama  s HIV rate is above the national HIV rate  Lives are on the line and I am committed to moving this legislation forward so that patients in Alabama and every state receive fair funding         Senator Coburn  a physician who has treated patients with HIV over the past two decades  stated   Congress should put the lives of all those living with HIV ahead of petty parochial and political interests that have stalled the CARE Act reauthorization for the past year and pass the compromise bill before October 1   It is unacceptable that federal funding is being allocated for dead people in one area  while patients in other areas are literally dying on waiting lists for AIDS drugs   The CARE Act must be updated to ensure access to treatment for all Americans living with HIV  promote early diagnosis  and provide more equitable funding that reflects the face of HIV AIDS today   The discrimination that renders Americans living with HIV in rural and Southern states as having only a fraction of the worth of those living elsewhere must end         The South has been particularly hard hit in recent years  with seven of the nation  s 10 highest AIDS rates located in the region   Most of the growth is occurring in the African American population  especially among African American women   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 40 000 people in the United States become infected with HIV each year  and more than 1 million Americans currently have HIV AIDS   Over 500 000 Americans have died as a result of AIDS      North Carolina has approximately 18 900 people living with HIV or AIDS   In 2004  66 7  of people living with AIDS in North Carolina were African Americans  the 5th highest rate in the nation   North Carolina currently ranks 14th among states with the greatest number of AIDS cases in the nation        Alabama has more than 10 000 people living with HIV   Another 5 000 may also be infected  but they don  t know their HIV status   While African Americans make up about 26 percent of Alabama  s population  they account for over 70 percent of new HIV AIDS cases   Further  a third of all new infections are among women of childbearing age   And unfortunately  the South has the highest death rate from AIDS of any area in the country      The Ryan White CARE Act Reauthorization  S  2823  legislation was favorably voted out of the Senate HELP Committee in May with only a single dissenting vote   It is awaiting action by the full Senate                               2004 United States
